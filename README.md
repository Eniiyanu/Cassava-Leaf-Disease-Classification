## Overview

Cassava plants are a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers in Africa due to its ability to withstand harsh outdoor elements. As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa and at least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, I (as a data scientist) have been tasked with helping to identify viral diseases on the plants as this is major reason of poor crop yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.

As it stands today, if farmers require help to detect disease within their crops, they must go through an arduous task of soliciting the help of government-funded agricultural experts, leading to delays in assuming crop damage and risk of destroying their entire crop base due to the spread of disease. 

As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.

In this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.

Your task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.
